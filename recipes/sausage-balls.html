                <h1>Sausage Balls</h1>
                <p>These 3-ingredient sausage balls are a real crowd pleaser, whether you serve them as a breakfast or
                    brunch treat, a party appetizer, a game-day nibble, or a holiday hors d'oeuvre. Savory sausage,
                    store-bought biscuit mix, and sharp Cheddar cheese team up for savory, cheesy flavor that can't be
                    beat. These are so yummy! My family makes every Christmas morning.</p>
                <h2>Ingredients</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 pound ground pork sausage, at room temperature</li>
                    <li>2 cups biscuit baking mix</li>
                    <li>1 pound sharp Cheddar cheese, shredded</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Directions</h2>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Combine room temperature sausage and biscuit mix in a large bowl; mix with your hands until
                            well combined. Add shredded Cheddar cheese and mix until fully incorporated. Roll mixture
                            into about 30 walnut-sized balls; transfer to a baking sheet.</p>
                    </li>

                        <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown and sausage is cooked through, 20 to 25
                            minutes.</p>
